# Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
1. The ticker symbol
2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.
5. Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:
6. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
# note
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
# Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds. Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

# Quarterly Stock Analysis 
## Overview
The Quarterly Analysis VBA Project is designed to automate the process of summarizing quarterly stock data across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. The macro calculates metrics such as total stock volume, quarterly change, and percentage change for each stock ticker. Additionally, it identifies the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and the stock with the highest total volume.
## Features
Calculates quarterly change and percentage change for stock tickers.
Highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
Identifies and displays the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and highest total volume.
Generates a summary table for each worksheet with comprehensive stock data.
